                <p>In an era where food waste is a pressing global issue, our team is dedicated to creating a web application that addresses this challenge head-on. The food waste application aims to tackle the issue of food wastage by providing a range of features to its users. Firstly, it allows users to input the ingredients available in their pantry and generates recipes based on those ingredients, encouraging users to utilize what they already have and minimize food waste. Secondly, the app includes a local food bank locator feature, helping users easily find and donate excess or unneeded food items to those in need. Additionally, it offers a local sharing app that facilitates the passing on of surplus food items between individuals, reducing waste and fostering a sense of community sharing. Moreover, the application provides resources and guidance on how to obtain surplus food from grocery stores, restaurants, and local farms, promoting sustainable consumption practices. Our application is designed to minimize food waste in households and communities by providing practical and easy-to-use solutions. The app's core functionalities include a pantry management system, a local food bank locator, and a community-sharing platform. Our application targets environmentally conscious individuals, families striving for zero-waste living, and community-oriented users. We aim to make a significant impact in the fight against food waste, fostering a more sustainable and compassionate world.

            <p>The wireframe for our app has been carefully designed with usability and simplicity in mind. Our goal is to let users use the site how they want as fast as possible, avoiding clustered menus or screens. Being a development team focused on eliminating food waste, we believe that an intuitive design is key in accomplishing our goals. We want to avoid a situation where users are dissuaded from our valuable services due to an unintuitive or confusing layout. This is very evident right away with the home screen, which welcomes users with a simplistic screen that can direct them to all other areas of the site. No matter why our users have chosen to use our site, they will have immediate access to where they are trying to go, ensuring they can accomplish what they are trying to do in a quick and easy fashion.</p>
            <img src="" alt="wire frame">
            <p>The recipe discovery sections of the site are a key area of our site that allows users plenty of freedom in the decisions they make. Users are once again prompted with a simple and straightforward layout in which they can select a type of food and a max time. This design makes sure that we provide users with the recipes that fit their current situation and mood instead of blindly throwing recipes at them. Once they have set this criteria, they will be brought to a list of all our recipes fitting their needs and provided some basic info for each individual recipe including a picture. Users can further filter down these recipes by things such as time to cook, servings, and name. Once they have finally found the right recipe, they will be brought to a page that lays out all the necessary information to craft the recipe in a straightforward fashion.</p>
            <img src="" alt="wire frame">
            <p>The pantry is another important area of the site in which users can manage the items they currently have available for them to cook. Users can view all their food items, categorized by whether they are a pantry, refrigerator, or freezer item. A bar at the bottom of each item clearly indicates the remaining shelf life of each item, incentivizing users to use up those items first to further help eliminate food waste. If users wish to add a new item or edit a currently existing item, we provide easy access to do so. When adding a new item, users follow a very simple process of searching up the item, verifying its the right item by the image, and then setting the quantity and expiration date. In just a few simple steps, users can add new items to their pantry, making it a breeze to do after each shop.</p>
            <img src="" alt="wire frame">
            <p>The resources area of the site is our informative area where we wish to better educate users about food waste and methods to reduce it. Here, we provide access to multiple pages regarding different methods to help reduce food waste or find surplus food. Each of these pages contain a set of tips on the topic and a list of external resources people can pursue if interested.</p>
            <img src="" alt="wire frame">
            <p>The food banks section of the site shows users a map of the local food banks in their area, allowing them to click around on each one to find out some contact information about it. If they wish to switch the location, users can quickly change the selected zip code to display a list of more local food banks. Together, these wireframes form an in-depth plan of our idea. Their emphasis on simplicity and functionality aim to greatly aid the success of the application and in turn the overall reduction of food waste.</p>
